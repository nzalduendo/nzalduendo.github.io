I am a postdoctoral reasearcher at CMM, working with <a href='https://www.dim.uchile.cl/~lsepulveda/'>Avelio Sepúlveda</a> and <a href='https://www.dim.uchile.cl/~dremenik/'>Daniel Remenik</a> on Myopic non-intersecting random paths. Prior to that, I worked as a postdoctoral reasearcher at the UMR Mistea with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/bertrandcloez'>Bertrand Cloez</a> studying the fluctuations of supercritical infinite-dimensional branching processes. My research focuses mainly in the interface of probability theory and population dynamics. My main interest is the study of processes describing the evolution of populations that can be affected by stochastic factors such as reproduction, mating, mutations or infections, and how these factors influence their asymptotic behavior both in long time and/or in large initial population settings. In particular, I am intereseted in models such as branching processes, individual-based models and growth-fragmentation processes. In 2023, I obtained my PhD degree at Université de Lorraine and INRIA Grand Est, under the supervision of <a href='http://coralie-fritsch.perso.math.cnrs.fr'>Coralie Fritsch</a> and <a href='http://www.normalesup.org/~villemonais/'>Denis Villemonais</a>, where I worked on the study of bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes. My PhD manuscript can be found <a href='https://theses.fr/2023LORR0285'>here</a>.
