I am a third year PhD student at Universit√© de Lorraine and INRIA Grand Est, working at Institut Elie Cartan de Lorraine in Nancy, under the supervision of <a href='http://coralie-fritsch.perso.math.cnrs.fr'>Coralie Fritsch</a> and <a href='http://www.normalesup.org/~villemonais/'>Denis Villemonais</a>. My current research focuses mainly in the interface of probability theory and mathematical models in biology. My main interest is the study of processes describing the dynamic of populations that can be affected by stochastic factors such as reproduction, mating, mutations or infections, and how these factors influence their asymptotic behavior both in long time and/or in large initial population settings. In particular, I am intereseted in models such as branching processes, individual-based models or SIR models. During my PhD thesis I am working on the study of bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes.
