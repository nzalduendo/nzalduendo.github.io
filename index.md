I am a postdoctoral reasearcher at INRAE Montpellier, working at the UMR Mistea with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/bertrandcloez'>Bertrand Cloez</a> where we work on the study of the fluctuations of supercritical branching processes. My research focuses mainly in the interface of probability theory and population dynamics. My main interest is the study of processes describing the dynamic of populations that can be affected by stochastic factors such as reproduction, mating, mutations or infections, and how these factors influence their asymptotic behavior both in long time and/or in large initial population settings. In particular, I am intereseted in models such as branching processes, individual-based models or SIR models. Previously, I obtained my PhD degree at Universit√© de Lorraine and INRIA Grand Est, working at Institut Elie Cartan de Lorraine in Nancy, under the supervision of <a href='http://coralie-fritsch.perso.math.cnrs.fr'>Coralie Fritsch</a> and <a href='http://www.normalesup.org/~villemonais/'>Denis Villemonais</a>, where I worked on the study of bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes. My PhD manuscript can be found <a href='https://theses.fr/2023LORR0285'>here</a>.
