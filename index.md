I am postdoctoral reasearcher at INRAE Montepllier, working at the UMR Mistea with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/bertrandcloez'>Bertrand Cloez</a>. My current research focuses mainly in the interface of probability theory and mathematical models in biology and ecology. My main interest is the study of processes describing the dynamic of populations that can be affected by stochastic factors such as reproduction, mating, mutations or infections, and how these factors influence their asymptotic behavior both in long time and/or in large initial population settings. In particular, I am intereseted in models such as branching processes, individual-based models or SIR models. Previously, I obtained my PhD degree at Universit√© de Lorraine and INRIA Grand Est, working at Institut Elie Cartan de Lorraine in Nancy, under the supervision of <a href='http://coralie-fritsch.perso.math.cnrs.fr'>Coralie Fritsch</a> and <a href='http://www.normalesup.org/~villemonais/'>Denis Villemonais</a>. During my PhD thesis I worked on the study of bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes.
