I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (DMCC) of the University of Santiago.

My research focuses mainly in the interface of probability theory and population dynamics. My main interest is the study of processes describing the evolution of populations that can be affected by stochastic factors such as reproduction, mating, mutations or infections, and how these factors influence their asymptotic behavior both in long time and/or in large initial population settings. In particular, I am intereseted in models such as branching processes, individual-based models and growth-fragmentation processes.
