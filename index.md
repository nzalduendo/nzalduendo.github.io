I am a third year PhD student at Universit√© de Lorraine and INRIA Grand Est, working at Institut Elie Cartan de Lorraine in Nancy, under the supervision of <a href='http://coralie-fritsch.perso.math.cnrs.fr'>Coralie Fritsch</a> and <a href='http://www.normalesup.org/~villemonais/'>Denis Villemonais</a>. My main interest is probability theory, in particular the long time behaviour of stochastic processes, such as (but not only) processes arising from biological and ecological models. Currently my research focuses on the study of bisexual branching processes.
