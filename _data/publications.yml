This result relies on a fourth moment assumption and the exponential convergence of the mean semigroup in a weighted total variation norm. This latter assumption is pretty weak and does not necessitate symmetric properties or specific spectral knowledge on this semigroup. In particular, we recover two of the three known regimes (namely the small and critical branching processes) of convergence in known cases, and extend them to a wider family of processes. To prove our central limit theorems, we use the Stein's method, which in addition allows us to newly provide a rate of convergence to this type of convergence."}

While classical subcritical Galton-Watson processes have been extensively analyzed, bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes present unique difficulties because of the lack of the branching property. To prove the existence of and convergence to one or several quasi-stationary distributions, we leverage on recent developments linking bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes extinction to the eigenvalue of a concave operator.'}

We assume that this function is superadditive, which in simple words implies that two groups of females and males will form a larger number of couples together rather than separate. Leveraging on concave Perron-Frobenius theory, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure extinction as well as a law of large numbers. Finally, we study the almost sure long-time convergence of the rescaled process through the identification of a supermartin- gale, and we give sufficient conditions to ensure a convergence in L1 to a non-degenerate limit.'}
