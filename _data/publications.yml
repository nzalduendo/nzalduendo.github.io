Videla', abstract: 'Deterministic sublinear growth models have been used recently to enlighten the diversity-stability debate. Some values of the parameter θ, quantifying the super- or sub-linearity of births or deaths in the model, lead to unbounded individual birth rates for small densities, which suggests that the path to extinction in these models might make them biologically unrealistic and hence unsuitable to model ecological dynamics. In this work, we examine stochastic birth-death and diffusion versions of these models, for which we fully characterize the extinction properties. Our analysis leads us to conclude that sublinear models show some mathematical appeal but should be taken with caution when modeling biological phenomena, since they give rise to stochastic dynamics that either never go extinct, even for small initial populations, or go extinct almost surely, but on unrealistically long time scales.'}
- {name: 'Central limit theorems for branching processes under mild assumptions on the mean semigroup,', url: 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18430', contributors: 'Bertrand Cloez', abstract: "We establish central limit theorems for a large class of supercritical branching Markov processes in infinite dimension with spatially dependent and non-necessarily local branching mechanisms. This result relies on a fourth moment assumption and the exponential convergence of the mean semigroup in a weighted total variation norm. This latter assumption is pretty weak and does not necessitate symmetric properties or specific spectral knowledge on this semigroup. In particular, we recover two of the three known regimes (namely the small and critical branching processes) of convergence in known cases, and extend them to a wider family of processes. To prove our central limit theorems, we use the Stein's method, which in addition allows us to newly provide a rate of convergence to this type of convergence."}

While classical subcritical Galton-Watson processes have been extensively analyzed, bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes present unique difficulties because of the lack of the branching property. To prove the existence of and convergence to one or several quasi-stationary distributions, we leverage on recent developments linking bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes extinction to the eigenvalue of a concave operator.'}
