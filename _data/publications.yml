It is known that, under a suitable rescaling, the distribution of M_N(p) converges, as N → ∞, to a one-parameter family of distributions interpolating between the Tracy-Widom distributions for the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary Ensembles (corresponding, respectively, to p → 1 and p → 0). It is also known that, for fixed N , M_N(1) is distributed as the top eigenvalue of a random matrix drawn from the Laguerre Orthogonal Ensemble. Here we show a version of these results for M_N(p) for fixed N , showing that M_N(p)/√p converges in distribution, as p → 0, to the righmost charge in a generalized Laguerre Unitary Ensemble, which coincides with the top eigenvalue of a random matrix drawn from the Antisymmetric Gaussian Ensemble'}
