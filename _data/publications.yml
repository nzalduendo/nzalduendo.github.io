We assume that this function is superadditive, which in simple words implies that two groups of females and males will form a larger number of couples together rather than separate. Leveraging on concave Perron-Frobenius theory, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure extinction as well as a law of large numbers. Finally, we study the almost sure long-time convergence of the rescaled process through the identification of a supermartin- gale, and we give sufficient conditions to ensure a convergence in L1 to a non-degenerate limit.'}
- {name: 'Restricted Maximum of Non-Intersecting Brownian Bridges,', url: 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11432', contributors: 'Yamit Yalanda', abstract: 'Consider a system of N non-intersecting Brownian bridges in [0,1], and let M_N(p) be the maximal height attained by the top path in the interval [0, p], p ∈ [0, 1]. It is known that, under a suitable rescaling, the distribution of M_N(p) converges, as N → ∞, to a one-parameter family of distributions interpolating between the Tracy-Widom distributions for the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary Ensembles (corresponding, respectively, to p → 1 and p → 0). It is also known that, for fixed N , M_N(1) is distributed as the top eigenvalue of a random matrix drawn from the Laguerre Orthogonal Ensemble. Here we show a version of these results for M_N(p) for fixed N , showing that M_N(p)/√p converges in distribution, as p → 0, to the righmost charge in a generalized Laguerre Unitary Ensemble, which coincides with the top eigenvalue of a random matrix drawn from the Antisymmetric Gaussian Ensemble.'}
